Use the following setup to debug serial interface on linux. 

run line sudo ./interceptty -s 'ispeed 9600 ospeed 9600' /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/interceptPtty 

This will monitor USB serial port 0 and create a new tty called interceptPtty. 
Connect to this to send out serial commands to USB
i.e. change /dev/ttyUSB0 to /dev/interceptPtty in application

You can test this using the minicom app:
sudo minicom -s to open settings

sudo minicom -c on to open app and start sending out serial messages
Make sure the minicom is connected to the interceptPtty
