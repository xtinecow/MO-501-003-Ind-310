Run StartupScript to begin process

This will setup the virtual port to the USB and name it interceptPtty
It will also call the StartNode script in parallel

The StartNode script will wait for 2 seconds while the interceptPtty is starting up and then start the NodeProgram

The 3 executables in here will be committed on Github because they should not change often. 
The only one that should change is the NodeProgram if the program changes. 

To make this script run on Startup: 

1. Setup an admin account on the raspberry pi with password 'capstone'. Set the option to always log into this automatically. 

2. Make sure both scripts have permission to be executed

3. Open .profile file from command terminal by using: 
pluma ~/.profile

4. Add the following line to end of .profile file
sh ~/path_to_Startup_folder/StartupScript.sh

NodeProgram will now be run off of bootup. Note that the pi won't be able to do anything else.
